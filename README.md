### What I Built:
- A fully functional RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
- Used MVC architecture for clean code separation.
- Defined a User model with virtuals, instance & static methods.
- Tested all routes in Postman for CRUD operations.
- Configured environment variables using dotenv.
