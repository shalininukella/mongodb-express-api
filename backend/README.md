### What I Built:
- A fully functional RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
- Used MVC architecture for clean code separation.
- Defined a User model with virtuals, instance & static methods.
- Tested all routes in Postman for CRUD operations.
- Configured environment variables using dotenv.


🎯 RESTful API with full CRUD (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

🧱 Mongoose Schema with:

Custom validation

Nested schema (address)

virtuals, statics, instance methods

populate for bestfriend relation

⚙️ Express Router with controllers cleanly separated (MVC pattern)

🔐 Environment config with .env and MONGO_URI

🧪 Tested via Postman (assumed done ✅)

🌍 Modular & scalable structure → real-world project-ready
